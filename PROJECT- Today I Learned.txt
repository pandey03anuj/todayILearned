React(17/3) Creating different Components.

header component
NewFactForm component
CategoryFilter comp
FactsList comp

Here style works differently
there it was in string now here in javascript
like backgroundColor is a property and string "Blue" as value

"Whenever somethings need to be changed on the screen we use STATE variables in React" 

React wants full control of input forms so we perform event handling
Have to fix this LATER if words in the input exceeds 200 the counter goes to negative values 

NOTE: await function can only be used in async function
